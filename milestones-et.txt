Report:
I never really liked doing networking stuff, but since thats a big part of this project I better start getting used to it.
But I love cpp more than I love js, so our group decision to use cpp in the backend is making the process smoother so far.
I got a barebones server running and tested for 2 users, I'm sure there'll be some tinkering for more but for now it looks good.
