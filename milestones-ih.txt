+12 A time log of what you worked on for the project, which will be included in your final report 
to Dr. Emrich. We expect roughly >= 4 hrs of work in addition to the 1 hours in lab (5 total)
+4 Evidence of a repository and code that you have checked in that matches 
at least one of your assigned task(s). 
+4 A rubric and short report on how this challenge went. 

time log:
- setup react env to render frontend: 30 min
- read up on react: 2 hrs [w3's react intro]
- postgres: 1 hr [https://dev.to/bnevilleoneill/getting-started-with-postgres-in-your-react-app-4nbn]
  - to interact with postgres we will host this on a server, and the app can make requests using the user id
  - will have to setup a login/create user form this can then limit user access in postgres and function as an identifier on the front end
'''
const Pool = require('pg').Pool
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'my_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'my_database',
  password: 'root',
  port: 5432,
});
'''
- rendering a webpage within the app for something like a gamepidgeon feature: 30 min 
  - ' <div> 
    <object type="text/html" data="http://validator.w3.org/" width="800px" height="600px" style="overflow:auto;border:5px ridge blue">
    </object>

Tasks:
- develop postgres implemenation
- develop implemntation for gp like apps

How this went:
Overall I enjoyed figuring my way through the react js world, particularly getting my partner's code running and finding where I would make modifications in the future. I don't really react itself since it's a language ontop of js and that is already a terrible experience, that being said I am hopeful that we can at the very least get a working app done.
